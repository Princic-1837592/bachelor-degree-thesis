Library for Exact Real Numbers using Golden Notation

This library is an implementation of [this research](https://users.dimi.uniud.it/~pietro.digianantonio/papers/copy_pdf/golden.pdf).
It uses a sort of exponent-mantissa representation for numbers in base `phi` to represent exact real numbers as an infinite stream of binary digits.

This library was developed for my bachelor degree thesis and is not intended for professional usage.
